# Gale Engine
## Introduction
The Gale Engine is a simple 2D game engine, developed by me using C++. Please note that this is my first engine, primarily created for educational purposes. It is written in C++ and utilizes the SFML library. The engine is comprised of two main components: the core and the app. The core is a static library housing the essential functions of the engine. The app serves as the executable for running the engine.

## Setup
The project uses Premake for building, aiming to keep the process as straightforward as possible. Here are the necessary steps:

1. Download the source code.
2. Customize the LuaScripts (Build.lua, Gale-Engine-Core/Build-Core.lua, Gale-Engine-App/Build-App.lua) if needed.
3. Execute the batch file in the scripts folder under Windows. The project file should now be created.

##Using the Engine
