# Gale Engine
## Introduction
The Gale Engine is a simple 2D game engine, which was created by me in C++.
Please note that this is my first engine and mainly has an educational purpose for me.
It was written in C++ and uses the SFML library. The engine is divided into two parts: the core and the app.
The core is a static library and contains the core functions of the engine. 
The app is the application for executing the engine.

## How to setup
Premake is used to build the project to keep it as simple as possible.
So here are the necessary steps:
1. download the source code.
2. customize the LuaScripts (Build.lua, Gale-Engine-Core/Build-Core.lua, Gale-Engine-App/Build-App.lua) if necessary
3. execute the batch file in the scripts folder under Windows
The project file should now have been created.

## How to use the Engine
